![sf_bridge_picture][Images/san_francisco_picture.png]

## Overview
#### Use the csv file san_francisco_housing.ipynb notebook to visualize and analyze the real-estate data to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

## Instructions
1. Calculate and plot the housing units per year.
2. Calculate and plot the average prices per square foot.
3. Compare the average prices by neighborhood.
4. Build an interactive neighborhood map.
5. Compose your data story.

### Results
Rental income has increased significantly more than the sales prices over the years. This overall trend of does hold true for all the neighborhoods across San Francisco. I would share the GeoViews plot to make better investments looking at the whole neighborhood. I would suggest to look at the darker color since the rent is lower.
